## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business problem: sales forecasting. By analyzing a dataset of advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspapers, this project builds and evaluates several regression models to predict future sales.

The primary goal is to create a reliable model that can help a business make data-driven decisions about its advertising strategy and resource allocation.

## Problem Statement

The core challenge is to develop a model that accurately predicts sales based on the money spent on different advertising platforms. This involves understanding the relationship between each advertising channel and its impact on sales revenue.

**Objectives:**
* To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find trends and correlations within the data.
* To build, train, and evaluate multiple regression models.
* To compare the models based on performance metrics like the R² score.
* To identify the most effective model for this prediction task.

---

## Technical Results

The primary evaluation metric used was the **R² (R-squared) score**, which measures how well the model's predictions approximate the real data points. After training and testing several models, the following results were obtained:

| Sl. No. | Regression Model                | Train R² (%) | Test R² (%) |
|:-------:|:--------------------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|
|    1    | Linear Regression               |     88.98    |    90.99    |
|    2    | Lasso (alpha = 0.01)            |     88.98    |    91.02    |
|    3    | Ridge (alpha = 1)               |     88.98    |    90.93    |
|    4    | Random Forest                   |     99.70    |    97.93    |
|    5    | **Gradient Boosting Regressor** |   **99.87** |   **98.17** |

The **Gradient Boosting Regressor** emerged as the top-performing model with a training accuracy of **99.87%** and a testing accuracy of **98.17%**, indicating its strong predictive power and ability to generalize to new data.

---

## Key Insights

* **Positive Correlation:** Sales show a strong positive correlation with advertising expenses, especially for TV and Radio channels.
* **TV Advertising Impact:** TV advertising expenditure was found to be the most significant predictor of sales.
* **Model Performance:** The Gradient Boosting model provided the most accurate predictions, making it the best choice for this specific business problem. These findings can help a business optimize its marketing budget for maximum return on investment.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy** for numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models.
* **Google Colab** for the development environment.
